9 (a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following:
10 (1) Entrepreneurs and innovators are building
11 and deploying this next generation of the internet.
12 (2) Digital commodity networks represent a
13 new way for people to join together and cooperate
14 with one another to undertake certain activities.
15 (3) Digital commodities have the potential to be
16 the foundational building blocks of these systems,
17 aligning the economic incentive for individuals to co18 operate with one another to achieve a common pur19 pose.
20 (4) The digital commodity ecosystem has the
21 potential to grow our economy and improve everyday
22 lives of Americans by facilitating collaboration
23 through the use of technology to manage activities,
24 allocate resources, and facilitate decision making.

1 parency, reduce transaction costs, and increase effi2 ciency if proper protections are put in place for in3 vestors, consumers, our financial system, and our
4 national security.
5 (6) Blockchain technology facilitates new types
6 of network participation which businesses in the
7 United States may utilize in innovative ways.
8 (7) Other digital commodity companies are set9 ting up their operations outside of the United
10 States, where countries are establishing frameworks
11 to embrace the potential of blockchain technology
12 and digital commodities and provide safeguards for
13 consumers.
14 (8) Digital commodities, despite the purported
15 anonymity, provide law enforcement with an excep16 tional tracing tool to identify illicit activity and bring
17 criminals to justice.
18 (9) The Financial Services Committee of the
19 House of Representatives has held multiple hearings
20 highlighting various risks that digital commodities
21 can pose to the financial markets, consumers, and
22 investors that must be addressed as we seek to har23 ness the benefits of these innovations.
